Notebook order : Features handling -> Vectorizing bio -> Calculate match

Steps :

1) The features are bifurcated into different dataframes to save memory allocation and only import when they are needed.

2) All categorical features except language column are label enocded and merged with numerical features

3) Language column is one hot encoded, merged with label encoded dataframe and saved into a csv file as 'features.csv'.

4) The bifurcated features and new dataframes are saved into csv files for use in other notebooks

5) Each row of bio feature is prepocessed and vectorised. Then it is merged with preprocessed features and dataframe is saved into csv file as 'refined data.csv'.

6) Match matrix is generated by calculating match perrcentage with cosine similarity method. User id is merged with match matrix and is saved into csv file as 'sub_lbl.csv'.
